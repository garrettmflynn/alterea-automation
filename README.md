## Usage
- Prepare your `.xlsx` file by including the string **queries** in the sheet that your queries are stored in. In addition, include **results** in the sheet that the automation results are stored in.
- Click the **Choose File** button and select your `.xlsx` file.
- You should now have a `alterea-superintendent-email-automation.xlsx` file in your downloads folder!

## Issues Outside of This Software
